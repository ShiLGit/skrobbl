    <h5>skrobbl is a word-guessing web game inspired by <a href = "https://skribbl.io" target = "_blank">skribbl.io</a></h5>
      <p class = "info-header">Win condition: have the most points at the end of the game. The way you earn points depends on your role for your current round:</p>

      <p class = "body"><strong>Typer (role):</strong> one per round. Choose one of three words for other players to guess. The game ends when every player has had a turn as the typer. You will receive points every time their word is guessed correctly.
      <br/><br/><strong>Guesser (role):</strong> guess the word the typer has chosen. The earlier you make a correct guess, the higher your score.</p>

      <p class = "info-header">There are two types of hints that typers can give to guessers to help them:</p>

      <p class = "body"><strong>Picture hints:</strong> an array of twelve buttons will be populated with random words at the beginning of the round. The typer will pick any word-buttons that are relevant to the secret word as a hint to the guessers.
      <br/><br/><strong>Word hints:</strong> the typer may type sentence hints for guessers to see. However, these hints are run through a language-translation service (?) multiple times to muddle their meaning.</p>
